<!-- 18. Making AJAX requests
Write a JavaScript file with jQuery that on document ready will:
make a ‘get’ request to the GitHub api using your username ('https://api.github.com/users/YOURUSERNAMEHERE')
this request should use the shorthand $.get() method.
make a ‘post’ request to a dummy database passing the data received from the GitHub request ('http://httpbin.org/post')
this request should use the long-form $.ajax({}) method and you should set your configuration object manually.
on the success callback for your post request, use jQuery create a <div> element. This <div> should include your avatar photo limited to 150px width (using jQuery, not a CSS Stylesheet), your username, and your real name.
append the div you create to the div with a class of ‘container’ with only one read/write function to the DOM.

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- This HTML will not change. Your jQuery will modify the DOM! -->
  </div>
  <script src='https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js'></script>
  <script src='script.js' type='text/javascript'></script>  <!-- this is the JavaScript file that you will write. -->
</body>
</html>
